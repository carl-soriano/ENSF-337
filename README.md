# ENSF-337
This repository is dedicated to showcasing the lab assignments completed for ENSF-337, a course that provides a comprehensive introduction and understanding of the fundamentals of C/C++ programming. The course is designed to equip students with the necessary skills to write efficient and effective programs in C/C++.

The assignments in this repository were completed using Xcode and may contain file path discrepancies when viewed in VSCode. This is due to the fact that different development environments have different file structures and naming conventions. However, all the codes in the assignments should still be present in the folder files.

It is also important to note that the code in this repository should not be used for plagiarism in any way. The University of Calgary takes plagiarism very seriously and has strict policies in place to prevent it. I strongly advise all students to refrain from plagiarizing, as it can result in severe consequences, including failing the course or expulsion from the university. This repository is intended for educational and reference purposes only.
